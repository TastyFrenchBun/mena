# mena-rust 

Tracker for currency written in Rust  

## Purpose

With **mena-rust** you can track any currency changes and optionally send it to **Telegram**  
It also was made as an example on how to put your Rust program inside a Pterodactyl

## Scheduling
**mena-rust** uses cron format for schedules.

For example, expression
`*/10 * * * * * *` will run each 10th second.  
You can check out cron expression generator [here](https://crontab.cronhub.io)

## Telegram
If you want to use **Telegram**, then follow these steps:  
1. Go to the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot
2. Click *"API Token"* button and copy value that should look like this â€” `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`
3. Go to the `config.toml`, enable telegram and paste your bot token

	Example:
	```toml
	[telegram]
	enabled = true
	bot_token = "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
	chat_id = "123456789"

	```
4. Restart *mena-rust*

If you want to use *mena-rust* with a channel, then you should be aware that bots have different IDs than users  

But you can still find your channel by supplying its username:
```toml
chat_id = "@menacurrency"
```
